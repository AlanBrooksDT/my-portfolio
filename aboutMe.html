    <div class="aboutMe">
        <P>A Father, a Husband, a budding Software Engineer. After 15+ years working in the Food and Drink industry, I recognised the need for change if I were to ever pursue a career in an area that I have a genuine interest in. I have just begun my career change journey into Software Development and expect there will be many twists and turns, but it's sure to be an adventure.</P><br>
    
        <p>This is my first website and is being used to put the theory into practice and I expect (hope) it will develop alongside my skill levels over the next few weeks and months. Please feel free to follow me through this journey or send me a message, or both. Job offers always welcome. As is cake.</p>
