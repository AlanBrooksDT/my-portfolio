    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a career change into software development as my present career path lacks the opportunity for growth and personal development.

        This is being balanced with family as my wife and I raise our 5 year old boy, Max, and 2 year old daughter, Emilia, who take up a lot of our time and attention.

        I have always enjoyed travelling, which has slowed down a little since the children came along but it is something we plan to do a lot more of in the future (assuming no further plagues encountered).

        Disclaimer: I am not a cat person.
